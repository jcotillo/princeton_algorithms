## Following along [Princeton's algorithms class I & II](https://github.com/dvklopfenstein/PrincetonAlgorithms/blob/master/doc/README.md)

The class is taught in *java* ~~(who even likes java?)~~ so I am following along the coursework and doing the examples in **Python 2.7** :)

Client code to test each example is found in the bottom of each file. I sprinkle in commentary relevant to new Python users like myself in some files as well. Doing this to practice algorithms!
